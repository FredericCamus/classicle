# Classicle

### About

Classicle is a wordle-like game in which you must guess the classical composer of the day given some clues!

The app can be found here: https://fredericcamus.github.io/classicle/.

Inspired by the geography guessing game [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/).

This app is built with the [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) javascript framework and uses data retrieved from the wonderful [Open Opus](https://github.com/openopus-org/openopus_api) dataset.

### Example

Here is what an example game looks like.
